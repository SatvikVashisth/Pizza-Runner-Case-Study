---Q1.) How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

SELECT DATEPART(week, runners.registration_date) AS Week_of_registrn, 
COUNT(runners.runner_id) AS Num_runners
FROM runners
GROUP BY DATEPART(week, runners.registration_date)


---Q2.) What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive
---     at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?


select runner_id, round(avg(datediff(minute, order_time, pickup_time)),1) as AvgTime
from runner_orders_0
inner join customer_orders
on customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders_0.order_id
where runner_orders_0.distance_km != 0
group by runner_id
order by AvgTime




---Q3.) Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?



WITH cte AS
(
SELECT customer_orders.order_id, COUNT(customer_orders.order_id) as PizzaCount, ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(MINUTE, order_time, pickup_time)),1) AS Avgtime
FROM customer_orders
JOIN runner_orders_0
ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders_0.order_id
WHERE runner_orders_0.distance_km != 0 
GROUP BY customer_orders.order_id
)
SELECT PizzaCount, AVG(Avgtime)
from cte
GROUP BY PizzaCount






---Q4.) What was the average distance travelled for each customer?



WITH cte AS
(
SELECT customer_orders.customer_id, ROUND(AVG(runner_orders_0.distance_km),1) AS AvgDistance
FROM customer_orders
JOIN runner_orders_0
ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders_0.order_id
WHERE runner_orders_0.distance_km != 0
GROUP BY customer_orders.customer_id
)
SELECT * 
FROM cte



---
ALTER TABLE runner_orders_0
ALTER COLUMN distance_km FLOAT

ALTER TABLE runner_orders_0
ALTER COLUMN duration_mins FLOAT
---


---Q5.) What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

SELECT MIN(duration_mins) AS min_durn, MAX(duration_mins) AS max_durn,
MAX(duration_mins) - MIN(duration_mins) AS max_difference
FROM runner_orders_0

---Q6.) What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

SELECT order_id, runner_id, distance_km, ROUND(60*distance_km/duration_mins, 2) AS avg_speed_kmperhr
FROM runner_orders_0
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
ORDER BY runner_id

---Q7.) What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

SELECT runner_id, ROUND(100*COUNT(pickup_time)/COUNT(*), 2)	AS successful_delvry_percentage
FROM runner_orders_0
GROUP BY runner_id
